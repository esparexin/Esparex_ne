## [2.5.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Developer Architecture Guide (`ARCHITECTURE.md`):** Added a root-level guide documenting Bounded Context topology, Ports & Adapters naming suffixes, and implementation patterns (Repository, UnitOfWork, Caching, and Composition Roots).
- **Bounded Context Migration Workflow (`.agents/workflows/bounded_context_migration.md`):** Established a repeatable 10-step template (Discovery, Repository Audit, Port Design, Adapter Implementation, UnitOfWork, Cache Decoupling, Controller Cleanup, Architecture Audit, Release Gate, and Pull Request) for all future domain modernizations.
- **Listings Cache Boundary:** Introduced `ListingsCachePort` and its concrete `RedisListingsCacheAdapter` implementation to isolate Redis primitives.
- **Listings Transaction Boundary:** Implemented `ListingUnitOfWorkPort` and `MongoListingUnitOfWorkAdapter` to encapsulate Mongoose sessions.

### Changed
- **Listings Bounded Context DDD Migration (#109):** Transitioned Listings services and controllers to DDD Ports & Adapters architecture. Removed direct database model (`AdModel`) and Mongoose/Redis client imports from core services and middleware utilities.
- **Catalog Bounded Context DDD Migration (#108):** Successfully migrated Catalog core entity validations, middlewares, and controllers to decouple database frameworks.
- **Workspace Configuration:** Updated root `README.md` and `.agents/AGENTS.md` guidelines to link to the new architecture standards.
