# Architecture Implementation Guide: DDD Core Consolidation

**Module**: 6B of 6 — Architecture Governance Framework

## 1. Incremental Refactoring Mandate

To preserve product feature velocity and minimize regression risk, **all refactoring toward the Hexagonal DDD architecture must execute via small, focused pull requests (PRs)**. Large repository-wide structural rewrites are strictly prohibited.

Every incremental PR must:
1. Address a single bounded context or a single migration phase.
2. Compile cleanly with zero type-checking errors.
3. Pass all 540 automated tests (`npm test` in workspaces).
4. Introduce no circular dependencies or boundary violations.

## 2. 5-Phase Execution Roadmap

The implementation of the target architecture is structured across five sequential, low-disruption phases:

### Phase 1 — Internal Core Refactor (Current Priority)
- **Goal**: Consolidate `core/` services into bounded context subdirectories without changing workspaces.
- **Action Items**:
  1. Introduce `core/domains/` directory.
  2. Migrate one bounded context at a time (`Catalog` ──► `Listings` ──► `Payments` ──► `Users` ──► `Chat`) into the standard CQRS-ready layout (application/domain/ports/validation).
  3. Create public `index.ts` barrels for each domain context.
  4. Eliminate all cross-domain deep imports, forcing consumers to go through the barrel facades.

### Phase 2 — Architecture Automation
- **Goal**: Enforce boundary integrity automatically in the CI pipeline.
- **Action Items**:
  1. Implement all verification scripts inside `tooling/architecture/` (`verify-boundaries.ts`, `verify-public-api.ts`, `verify-manifests.ts`, `verify-dependencies.ts`, `verify-ports.ts`, `verify-adapters.ts`, `verify-foundation.ts`, `architecture-scorecard.ts`, `dependency-graph.ts`, `ownership-report.ts`).
  2. Add strict `dependency-cruiser` rules enforcing ports-and-adapters isolation and layer constraints.
  3. Add ESLint rules blocking deep subdirectory imports across domains.
  4. Generate and print scorecard reports on each pull request.

### Phase 3 — Outbound Adapters & Outbox Refinement
- **Goal**: Introduce clean integration adapters and reliable event pipelines.
- **Action Items**:
  1. Standardize Hexagonal outbound adapters in `core/adapters/outbound/` implementing their respective ports.
  2. Implement the Transactional Outbox pattern inside `core/infrastructure/persistence/` for reliable integration event publishing.
  3. Configure adapter observability to emit standardized logs, metrics, and trace spans.

### Phase 4 — Shared Package & Runtime Evolution
- **Goal**: Evolve universal packages and server delivery runtimes.
- **Action Items**:
  1. Audit `@esparex/shared` and narrow its scope to true cross-platform contracts.
  2. Extract specialized packages (e.g. `packages/contracts`, `packages/foundation`, `packages/ui`) only when a package has a single, well-defined responsibility.
  3. Relocate Express REST controllers to `services/api/` and extract background task queues to `services/worker/` and `services/scheduler/`.

### Phase 5 — Domain Graduation
- **Goal**: Graduate mature domain modules into standalone root-level packages.
- **Action Items**:
  1. Evaluate candidate domains against the Graduation Gate Criteria.
  2. Relocate the directory from `core/domains/<domain-name>/` to the root `domains/<domain-name>/` workspace via `git mv` only when team ownership, low coupling, and independent deployment needs are verified.

## 3. Consolidation Milestones

| Milestone | Goal | Primary Verification Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **M1** | Create the new `core/domains/` structure without changing behavior. | Clean compile & passing types. |
| **M2** | Move Catalog into the new structure and verify all tests pass. | All unit tests pass (`npm run test -w @esparex/core`). |
| **M3** | Move Listings. | All unit tests pass. |
| **M4** | Move Payments and Wallet. | All unit tests pass. |
| **M5** | Introduce ports and adapter outbound implementations incrementally. | Strict dependency-cruiser boundary gate. |
| **M6** | Enable all architecture verification scripts in CI. | Custom validation scripts block pull requests. |
| **M7** | Generate architecture scorecards on every pull request. | HTML/JSON scorecard reports auto-published. |
| **M8** | Remove the legacy flat `core/services/` layout completely. | Git file-deleted verification. |
