## 1. Hexagonal Ports & Adapters Suffix Standards

To ensure consistency and high readability across our Hexagonal Architecture boundaries, we enforce strict naming suffixes:

| Archetype | Suffix | Placement | Allowed Imports | Examples |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Port** | `Port` | `core/domains/<domain>/ports/` | Primitive types, building blocks, domain entities. | `PaymentGatewayPort`, `StoragePort`, `EmailPort` |
| **Adapter** | `Adapter` | `core/adapters/outbound/` or `inbound/` | Vendor SDKs, ports, configuration schemas. | `RazorpayAdapter`, `ZeptoMailAdapter` |
| **Repository Port** | `RepositoryPort` | `core/domains/<domain>/ports/` | Domain entities, value objects, ID structures. | `ListingRepositoryPort`, `CategoryRepositoryPort` |
| **Persistence** | `RepositoryAdapter` | `core/adapters/outbound/` | Database models, schemas, repositories, ports. | `MongoListingRepositoryAdapter` |

## 2. Shared Kernel Standard & Content Budget (Internal Core)

The internal core shared folder (`core/shared-kernel/`) contains foundational domain primitives, value objects, base errors, and events plumbing consumed universally across multiple bounded contexts. To prevent this folder from slowly degrading into a generic "common" utilities folder, we enforce an objective reference budget, strict compliance boundaries, and automatically checked CI constraints:

- **Reference Budget Threshold**: Utilities inside `core/shared-kernel/` (excluding event bus interfaces) may **only contain code referenced by three or more bounded contexts**.
- **Objective Shared Kernel Admission Rules**: An item is eligible for inclusion in `core/shared-kernel/` only if all of the following criteria are true:
  - [ ] **Used by three or more bounded contexts** (must be consumed universally).
  - [ ] **Domain agnostic** (contains no business-specific domain context knowledge).
  - [ ] **No infrastructure dependency** (no imports of database models, schemas, or technical packages).
  - [ ] **No adapter dependency** (does not depend on any outbound or inbound adapters).
  - [ ] **No transport dependency** (completely decoupled from HTTP, Express, REST, or messaging controllers).
  - [ ] **No UI dependency** (contains zero CSS, layout styling, or frontend client logic).
  - [ ] **Explicit owner** (ownership must be clearly defined in manifests).
  - [ ] **Unit tested** (100% covered by independent unit tests).
- **Shared Kernel Size Limit**: Maximum `25` files/classes and `10` directories.
- **Escalation Trigger**: If a file inside the shared kernel is referenced by fewer than three contexts, or if the size limit is exceeded, the code must be relocated to the specific business domain that consumes it.

### Content Boundaries
To prevent general helper functions and delivery/persistence details from bloating the shared kernel, we enforce strict binary criteria:

```text
Allowed Core Shared Kernel Building Blocks:
✓ Result / Either (Operation outcomes)
✓ Money / Percentage / Coordinates (Shared Value Objects)
✓ Email / Identifier / UniqueId (Domain Primitive Types)
✓ DomainError / AppError / NotFoundError (Shared Exceptions)
✓ Option / Maybe / Clock / Invariant (Standard Platform Primitives)

Forbidden Core Shared Kernel Elements:
✗ DateUtils / StringUtils (Belongs in packages/utils/)
✗ PhoneUtils / phoneFormatter (Belongs in packages/utils/)
✗ CatalogHelpers (Belongs in core/domains/catalog/)
✗ Validation (DTO schemas belong in application/validation/ or packages/contracts/)
✗ Formatting (Belongs in packages/utils/)
✗ Logger (Belongs in packages/config/ or packages/utils/)
```

---

## 3. `packages/foundation/` Content Boundaries (External Workspace Package)

To prevent `packages/foundation/` from accumulating miscellaneous helper utilities, the package enforces a binary allowed/forbidden rule set:

```text
Allowed:
✓ Either (Result type)
✓ Result<T> (Operation outcomes)
✓ Option / Maybe (Nullable abstractions)
✓ Identifier / UniqueId (Domain ID bases)
✓ Money (Financial Value Object)
✓ Email / Percentage (Basic Domain Primitives)
✓ UUID / Clock / Invariant (Core Platform Abstractions)

Forbidden:
✗ Helpers / Utils (Belongs in packages/utils/)
✗ DateUtils / StringUtils (Belongs in packages/utils/)
✗ Validation / Schemas (Belongs in shared/ or packages/contracts/)
✗ Formatting (Belongs in packages/utils/)
✗ CatalogUtils / domainSpecifics (Belongs in core/domains/<domain>/)
```

## 4. Bounded Context Events Directory Layout

Concrete events belong strictly to the domain context that owns them.
- **Domain Events** (e.g. `ListingCreated`): Reside inside their respective domain boundaries under `core/domains/<domain>/domain/events/`.
- **Integration Events** (e.g. `PaymentCapturedIntegrationEvent`): Reside inside their respective domain boundaries under `core/domains/<domain>/domain/events/` and are exposed via the domain index barrel.
- **Shared Eventing Plumbing**: Interface contracts like `EventBus`, `EventEnvelope`, `EventSerializer`, and `EventDispatcher` reside globally under `core/shared-kernel/events/`. No concrete events are permitted inside this directory.

---

## 5. Domain Manifest YAML Specification (`manifest.yaml`)

Every bounded context under `core/domains/*` must maintain a `manifest.yaml` validating its metadata, ownership, stability, and operational boundaries:

```yaml
id: catalog                 # Bounded context identifier (stable, outlives org charts)
name: Catalog Domain        # Human-readable domain name
owner: catalog              # Bounded context tag (stable domain, not team name)
business_owner: Marketplace # Marketplace | Core | Support
technical_owner: Platform   # Platform | Architecture | Security
maintainer: Catalog Squad   # Current maintaining squad
maturity: stable            # experimental | growing | stable | strategic
visibility: public          # public | private
stability: stable           # stable | experimental
criticality: high           # low | medium | high | mission-critical
sla: tier-1                 # tier-1 (high availability) | tier-2 (standard) | tier-3 (batch)
since: 1.0                  # Baseline version
layer: domain               # Layer classification
depends_on:                 # Explicit imports
  - shared
  - core/shared-kernel
public_api:                 # Declared public barrel exports
  facades:
    - CatalogFacade
  ports:
    - CategoryRepositoryPort
```

## 6. Bounded Context Reference Implementation

The Catalog context represents the baseline Reference Architecture for all bounded contexts in the Esparex codebase:

- **Reference Commit**: `2860b4d` (Catalog), `2912ca1a` (Listings)
- **Modularity Checklist**:
  - **Public API**: Exposed strictly via barrel index [index.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Documents/GitHub/Esparex/core/src/domains/catalog/index.ts). No deep internal imports allowed.
  - **Decoupled Business Services**: Core domain validations/services contain zero mongoose, direct database model imports, or query builders.
  - **Ports & Adapters Separation**: Port interfaces define business capabilities ([CategoryRepositoryPort.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Documents/GitHub/Esparex/core/src/domains/catalog/ports/CategoryRepositoryPort.ts)). Concrete repositories ([MongoCategoryRepository.ts](file:///c:/Users/Administrator/Documents/GitHub/Esparex/core/src/adapters/outbound/database/catalog/MongoCategoryRepository.ts)) map raw database formats to domain models.
  - **Pure Entities**: Domain models mapped by adapters are plain, read-only JS/TS objects with immutable configuration.
  - **Dependency Guards**: Regressions are blocked automatically by Dependency Cruiser and circularity checks in CI.

## 7. Architecture Patterns & Conventions

### UnitOfWork Pattern (Transaction Abstraction)
To prevent leakage of database transaction details (like Mongoose `ClientSession`) into application services, we use the `UnitOfWork` pattern:
- **Port**: `ListingUnitOfWorkPort` defines an `executeTransaction` method accepting an opaque session type.
  ```typescript
  export interface ListingUnitOfWorkPort {
      executeTransaction<T>(work: (session: unknown) => Promise<T>): Promise<T>;
  }
  ```
- **Adapter**: `MongoListingUnitOfWorkAdapter` implements the transaction using Mongoose's `session.withTransaction` internally.
- **Application Services**: Consume the port via the composition root, passing `session` as `unknown` to ensure complete database framework independence:
  ```typescript
  await getListingUnitOfWork().executeTransaction(async (session) => {
      await getListingRepository().updateOne(id, patch, session);
  });
  ```

### Repository Pattern (Database Abstraction)
All persistence-layer queries and commands are routed through a domain-defined Repository Port:
- **Port**: `ListingRepositoryPort` defines standard CRUD and domain-specific query methods using plain TS objects.
- **Adapter**: `MongoListingRepositoryAdapter` handles the Mongoose schema interaction, maps MongoDB documents using a `toDomain()` mapping function, and implements the queries.
- **Controllers & Middlewares**: Call `getListingRepository().findOne(...)` instead of directly importing `AdModel` or writing raw Mongoose queries.

### Cache Abstraction Pattern
Rather than calling Redis client helpers (like `redisCache`) directly, the application layer declares its invalidation needs through a business-intent-focused cache port:
- **Port**: `ListingsCachePort` exposes only business-intent invalidation methods:
  ```typescript
  export interface ListingsCachePort {
      invalidateAdFeedCaches(): Promise<void>;
      invalidatePublicAdCache(adId: string): Promise<void>;
  }
  ```
- **Adapter**: `RedisListingsCacheAdapter` calls the low-level Redis caching helpers.
- **Core Services & Listeners**: Call `getListingsCache().invalidateAdFeedCaches()` via the composition root, keeping business logic clean of infrastructure caching mechanics.

### Composition Root Pattern
Dependencies are wired together at the package boundary in a central composition root (`core/src/composition/<domain>.ts`):
- Singleton instance factories (e.g. `getListingRepository()`, `getListingUnitOfWork()`, `getListingsCache()`) instantiate adapters and return their port interfaces.
