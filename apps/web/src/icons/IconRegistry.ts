/**
 * Central Icon Registry – ESPAREX
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS:
 * - Single source of truth for ALL UI icons
 * - Prevents random icon imports across the codebase
 * - Enables tree-shaking and PWA optimization
 * - Makes future refactors safe and predictable
 *
 * RULE:
 * ❌ NEVER import icons directly from lucide-react anywhere else
 * ✅ ALWAYS import from "@/icons/IconRegistry"
