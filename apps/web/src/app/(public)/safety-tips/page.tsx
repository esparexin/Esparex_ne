                        <p><strong>1. Never pay in advance:</strong> Do not transfer money (via UPI, bank transfer, or digital wallets) to individual sellers before inspecting the spare part or device in person. Be cautious of sellers demanding {"\""}booking fees{"\""} or {"\""}shipping charges{"\""} upfront.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Use Esparex Chat:</strong> Do not move conversations to WhatsApp or Telegram immediately. Keeping your negotiations and proof of agreements within the Esparex chat portal protects you in case you need to report abusive or fraudulent behavior.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Buy from Verified Businesses:</strong> Whenever possible, purchase critical components (like screens or motherboards) from sellers with the <span className="font-semibold text-emerald-600">{"\""}Verified Business{"\""}</span> shield. These sellers have legitimate GST registrations on file with us.</p>

                        <p><strong>1. Verify the Payment:</strong> If completing a transaction digitally at a meetup, wait until you see the SMS from your *own bank* confirming the deposit. Do not rely solely on screenshots shown by the buyer, as fake UPI payment apps do exist in the wild.</p>
                        <p><strong>2. Be Transparent:</strong> Clearly state if a part is OEM, refurbished, or an aftermarket compatible component. Disclosing minor faults prevents post-sale disputes and builds your long-term reputation.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Protect Your Personal Info:</strong> Do not share your home address, Aadhaar number, or credit card details via chat. Share your shop address or a public location.</p>
