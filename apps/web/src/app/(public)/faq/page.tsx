        question: "How does Esparex protect buyers?",
        answer: "Esparex actively verifies business sellers by verifying their KYC and GST documents. We recommend communicating through our built-in chat, inspecting items thoroughly during local meetups, and avoiding upfront payments to unverified sellers."
    },
    {
        question: "Is it free to sell on Esparex?",
        answer: "Yes! Posting basic ads for spare parts or used electronics is completely free. We also offer premium Spotlight features and verified Business Storefront plans for sellers who want maximum visibility."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I book a repair service?",
        answer: "Navigate to the 'Services' section on the homepage or search for your device model. You'll find verified technicians in your area. You can chat directly with them to negotiate pricing and arrange an on-site visit or a shop walk-in."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I upgrade to a Business Account?",
        answer: "Go to your Account Settings and click 'Register Business'. You will be asked to upload standard business documents (like GST or Shop Establishment Act). Once our moderation team approves it, your listings will feature a 'Verified Business' badge."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the difference between OEM and Compatible parts?",
        answer: "OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts are official parts made by the original brand. Compatible (or Aftermarket) parts are third-party replacements that are often cheaper but vary in quality. Esparex sellers are required to specify part authenticity in their listings."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I ship products to buyers?",
        answer: "Currently, Esparex specializes in hyper-local discovery. You and the buyer must arrange any shipping and payment individually. We strongly recommend local, in-person exchanges for the highest security."
